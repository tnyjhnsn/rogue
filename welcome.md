*Version 1.0.0*

**This game is still a work in progress, but I think OK for initial release.**

For more information, and complete details of the game design, visit the library on the town level. Take a look around the town before you go into the dungeons. You may need to buy some things before you go.

###To move around the game
* `Arrow keys` for up, down, left and right
* `y`, `u`, `b`, `n` for diagonal
* `<` when on a staircase to go down a level
* `>` when on a staircase to go up a level
* `?` for help

Mouseover items and monsters for extra information. Activity and other messages are displayed below the main board. Status is displayed top right. **If your HP reaches 0 and you die, the game will restart from 0. There is no save.** HP are automatically restored over time (2 points per 5 turns), however, there are some health potions available to boost this.

You can use the mouse for movement on the main board BUT this is still beta. Due to the random nature of choosing a suitable tile to walk on, it may brush pass monsters and allow them a free hit at you. It is better to use the keyboard when in melee or approaching and fleeing monsters. All movement is turn based. After every turn you make (see turn counter top right) the game will generate it’s own turn.

###Getting items
To pick up items on the board, move to that item's location and a list of items will appear to the left of the board. Select them using the mouse OR the “g” key. Items picked up will be moved to your pack (first list on the right of the board). Depending on the type of item, you can then choose to wear it, eat it, or use it.

###Using Items
Your body has slots for **Weapon, Bow, Quiver, Ring Left, Ring Right, Necklace, Armour** and **Shield.** Selecting to wear an item will move it from your pack to your body. Any item already on that part of your body will be swapped back into your pack. Your pack is limited to 6 items. Items may be dropped from your pack back onto your location on the board EXCEPT in the town, you must be on your home tile to drop items.

You also have a purse for holding **gold** and **adamantite**. Adamantite is needed to purchase some items from the vendors in the town. Gold is dropped by monsters and adamantite “grows” in hard to reach places and sometimes even deep within the walls where you have to mine for it.

###Attacking Monsters
1. If you have bow and arrows, you can click on the monster to shoot at it. Arrows are limited (see the counter). You cannot shoot a monster at close range.
2. For melee (hand-to-hand) combat, keep moving into the monster from any direction.

After every turn you make, the game has a turn. Monsters may fight back, run away, breed, or wander depending on their class and other random effects. Most monsters *WILL* attack you on sight.
